# Data-Science
This repository contains projects that I have done in data science both academic and extra curricular

1) Markov Model of Natural Language

The project is based on the Markov Models of Natural Language which when seeded with a small amount of text, create a large corpus of text similar to the seed text. Here I use first 10 chapters of Jane Austins book "Emma" to create a much simpler language model to generate text. I create an nth - order Markov Model which generates a string of text one letter at a time based on the most recent n block of letters. The model then adds the last letter of the n+1 block of text based on its probability of occurrence in the entire text( first 10 chapters of Jane Austins book "Emma").

2) Page Rank 

This project is based on the page rank algorithm to rank individual elements in a complex system. Here I impliment a similar algorithm on the "Hamilton" dataset to count the number of time a user surfs over a webpage considering references between characters as links between webpages. Based on a set limit of iterations, calculated the page rank which is essentialy the frequency of reference of each link.
